How to Add Your Elovient Logo as Favicon

1. Save the purple Elovient logo you've attached in the chat
2. Name it "favicon.png"
3. Place it in this directory (ElovientWebsite/public/)
4. Make sure its size is appropriate for a favicon (32x32 or 64x64 pixels)
5. If needed, use an online tool like favicon.io to optimize it

The website is already configured to use this file as the favicon.
